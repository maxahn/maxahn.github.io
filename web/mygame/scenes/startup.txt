You're walking down a long hallway that never ends. At least, you don't think it ends.
It feel as though you've been walking forever but time tends to do its own thing in dreams
and you are most definitely dreaming. Where else but in a dream could a hallway stretch for
so long without a single door? Where the off-white walls looks smooth one second, and then
bumpy the next? Where the never ending stretch of the reddish brown carpet makes you scowl
in distate at their ugliness? 

Hm, you suppose that last one isn't a very strong argument but nonetheless, you know with a
certain level of clarity that rarely follows you in real life, that this is a dream. 

"When do you think we'll reach the end?" The young boy walking besides you asks.
He stares ahead down the hallway as he walks, wearing a dark blue baseball cap with a stain on the rim.
You can't see his face due to the cap, and for that, you are grateful.

An almost comically oversized pink backpack twice his size hangs on his back, the frayed straps swaying rythmically
to the steady cadence of his stride. The backpack looks uncomfortably heavy and bulky but the child seems
to be unbothered by it, if a bit hunched over.

"Hello? I asked a question," the boy says, turning his head to look up at you now.
You don't shudder but you most definitely purse your lips. The boy has no face, just an emptiness that
never fails to unsettle you. Often, you wondered what would happen if you were to reach inside.

Would the hole close, cutting your arm off? Would your hand find something deep inside, like a brain or a heart?
Would something grab your hand and wrench it down with the rest of your body as the hole widens and closes around you like the jaw of
a python? Fun little thoughts like that.

Even if this is a dream, there are plenty of things you are not eager to try and that is one of them. You've tried throwing things into face
holes-as you like to call them-before but they just disappear and nothing really happens after as consequence. 

Finally, the boy grabs your sleeve and tugs at it with surprising vigor, pulling it from side to side. "Hellooo? Anyone in there??"

  #"I don't know."

    "Why don't you know?"

    "Because I don't."

    "You're not very helpful, are you?"

    "Well, I'm not really here to help."

    "Why are you here, then?"

    You ponder upon this for a moment before answering.

    "I don't know." 

    "Do you know anything?"

    You laugh. "I know a few things, yeah."

    "Doesn't seem like it."

    *finish

  #"Soon."

    "How soon?"

    "Soon enough."

    "Great, I'm getting real bored of walking."

    You walk on in silence. Some unmeasurable amount of time passes before the boy speaks again.

    "Who are you, anyways?" He pauses. "Actually, I'm not supposed to speak with strangers."

    "That's pretty good advice. Feel free not to speak to me," you smile, making sure to keep your gaze pointed straight ahead.   

    "You're no fun," he says with plenty of grumble in his voice. You'd imagine he'd be pouting if he had a face to pout with. 

    *finish

  #"Do you want it to end?"
    You glance at the boy who keeps walking in silence. 

    "I think I do," he finally says.

    When you look back down the hallway, you see the end. The door is the perfect height for the boy, but you'd have

    to crouch to get through. 
    
    "Well, I guess I'll go now. See you around?" The boy asks, looking up at you. You try not to stare directly into his face hole. 

    "Probably not."

    The boy shrugs and steps through the door. He's momentarily stuck as his large pink backpack is a bit too wide for the small door
    but you give it a firm kick and he's sent flying through with a yelp that might have made you chuckle a bit too hard.
